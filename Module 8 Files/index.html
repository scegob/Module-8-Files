		<p>This page is an example of how FLOAT can be used rather than ABSOLUTE positioing.</p>
		<p>It also places DIVs inside of a DIV to help us control spacing.  So there is information for a CONTENT section and a MENU section. But they use some similar CSS rules.</p>
		<p>Notice that to get the text itself to align the way we want it to, we have to enter it in a particular relation - in this case after those floating images to get the effect we have here.</p>
		<p>Depending upon how much content we have, the division will shift a bit.  If we put too much content in, we might want to add the OVERFLOW rule to help control scrolling and to make sure that our content doesn't extend outside of the DIV itself.</p>
